# 📘 YouTube Comment Analyzer

## 🧠 Introduction

**YouTube Comment Analyzer** is a web-based tool that allows users to extract and analyze comments from any public YouTube video. With just a video URL, the tool fetches comments via the YouTube Data API, performs sentiment analysis, and presents the results with visual insights and download options.

### 🔍 What is it?
A lightweight web application that:
- Fetches comments from any YouTube video
- Performs sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral)
- Allows users to download results in CSV, Excel (XLSX), or JSON
- Displays visual summaries (e.g., sentiment pie chart)

### 💡 Why build it?
YouTube is a massive source of user feedback, public opinion, and engagement insights. This tool helps:
- Researchers understand audience sentiment
- Content creators gather viewer feedback at scale
- Analysts extract structured insights from unstructured comments
